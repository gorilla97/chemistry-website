      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio website! I am passionate about learning, exploring new fields, 
        and applying my knowledge in practical ways. With a strong foundation in computer science 
        and a deep curiosity for how the world works, I am always eager to take on new challenges 
        and expand my horizons.

        I have a background in classical piano, with over ten years of training, and I am currently 
        working on improving my jazz and improvisational skills. Outside of music, I enjoy 
        competitive sports, especially basketball, and I love spending time outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey has been shaped by my family's values and my experiences in different domains, 
        from academics to volunteering and research. I believe in the power of technology to make 
        a positive impact, and I am excited to share my projects and experiences with you.
